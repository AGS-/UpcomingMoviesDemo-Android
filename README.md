## Third party Libraries
### Retrofit
I chose to use retrofit for all of the networking because it has by
far become the golden standard as far as networking libraries go.
It's fast, it's easy to use, and it has all of the features I needed
for this app.

### Picasso
I' using Picasso to handle all of the image loading since it has built
in caching and integrates well with RecyclerView. It is also extremely
easy to implement.
